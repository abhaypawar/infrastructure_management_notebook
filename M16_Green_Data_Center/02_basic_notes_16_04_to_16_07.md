### Power Usage Effectiveness and Other Metrics

Measuring efficiency through standardized metrics remains crucial for data center sustainability:

#### Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)

PUE remains the most widely used data center efficiency metric, though it's increasingly viewed as just one component of a broader sustainability framework:

**Definition**:
```
PUE = Total Facility Power / IT Equipment Power
```

**Components**:
- **Total Facility Power**: All power dedicated to the data center (IT, cooling, lighting, etc.)
- **IT Equipment Power**: Power used by computing equipment (servers, storage, network)

**Industry Benchmarks (2025)**:
- **Legacy Data Centers**: 1.7-2.0
- **Enterprise Average**: 1.4-1.6
- **Hyperscale Leaders**: 1.07-1.15
- **Theoretical Minimum**: 1.0

**PUE Calculator**:

```python
def calculate_pue(total_facility_power, it_equipment_power):
    """
    Calculate Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
    
    Args:
        total_facility_power: Total power consumed by the facility (kW)
        it_equipment_power: Power consumed by IT equipment (kW)
    
    Returns:
        PUE value as a float
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs are invalid
    """
    if total_facility_power <= 0 or it_equipment_power <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Power values must be positive")
    
    if it_equipment_power > total_facility_power:
        raise ValueError("IT equipment power cannot exceed total facility power")
    
    pue = total_facility_power / it_equipment_power
    
    return pue

# Example usage
try:
    # Example values
    total_power = 5000  # kW
    it_power = 4000  # kW
    
    pue_value = calculate_pue(total_power, it_power)
    print(f"PUE: {pue_value:.2f}")
    
    # PUE classification
    if pue_value < 1.2:
        efficiency = "Very Efficient"
    elif pue_value < 1.5:
        efficiency = "Efficient"
    elif pue_value < 2.0:
        efficiency = "Average"
    else:
        efficiency = "Inefficient"
    
    print(f"Efficiency Classification: {efficiency}")
    
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**PUE Limitations**:
- Doesn't account for IT equipment efficiency
- Doesn't consider renewable energy sources
- No indication of water usage or carbon impact
- Can be manipulated through measurement methodology

#### Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)

As data centers increasingly impact local water resources, WUE has become a critical sustainability metric:

**Definition**:
```
WUE = Annual Water Usage (liters) / IT Equipment Energy (kWh)
```

**Industry Benchmarks (2025)**:
- **Traditional Cooling**: 2.0-4.0 L/kWh
- **Best Practices**: 0.5-1.0 L/kWh
- **Advanced Systems**: <0.2 L/kWh
- **Air-Cooled Only**: 0.0 L/kWh

**WUE Calculator**:

```python
def calculate_wue(annual_water_usage_liters, annual_it_energy_kwh):
    """
    Calculate Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)
    
    Args:
        annual_water_usage_liters: Annual water consumption (liters)
        annual_it_energy_kwh: Annual IT equipment energy usage (kWh)
    
    Returns:
        WUE value as a float (L/kWh)
    """
    if annual_water_usage_liters < 0 or annual_it_energy_kwh <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input values")
    
    wue = annual_water_usage_liters / annual_it_energy_kwh
    
    return wue

# Example calculation
annual_water = 5000000  # 5 million liters
annual_energy = 10000000  # 10 million kWh

wue_value = calculate_wue(annual_water, annual_energy)
print(f"WUE: {wue_value:.2f} L/kWh")
```

#### Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE)

DCiE is the reciprocal of PUE, providing a percentage-based view of efficiency:

**Definition**:
```
DCiE = (1/PUE) × 100% = (IT Equipment Power / Total Facility Power) × 100%
```

**Industry Benchmarks (2025)**:
- **Legacy Data Centers**: 50-60%
- **Enterprise Average**: 65-75%
- **Hyperscale Leaders**: 85-95%
- **Theoretical Maximum**: 100%

**DCiE Calculator**:

```python
def calculate_dcie(pue=None, it_power=None, total_power=None):
    """
    Calculate Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE)
    
    Args:
        pue: Power Usage Effectiveness value
        it_power: IT equipment power (kW)
        total_power: Total facility power (kW)
    
    Returns:
        DCiE value as a percentage
    
    Note:
        Provide either PUE or both power values
    """
    if pue is not None:
        if pue <= 0:
            raise ValueError("PUE must be positive")
        dcie = (1 / pue) * 100
    elif it_power is not None and total_power is not None:
        if it_power <= 0 or total_power <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Power values must be positive")
        if it_power > total_power:
            raise ValueError("IT power cannot exceed total power")
        dcie = (it_power / total_power) * 100
    else:
        raise ValueError("Either PUE or both power values must be provided")
    
    return dcie

# Example from PUE
print(f"DCiE from PUE 1.5: {calculate_dcie(pue=1.5):.1f}%")

# Example from power values
print(f"DCiE from powers: {calculate_dcie(it_power=4000, total_power=5000):.1f}%")
```
